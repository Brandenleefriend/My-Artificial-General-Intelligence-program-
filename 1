Model Architecture:https://www.blackbox.ai/agent/limitless4fEWxha
My model architecture is based on the Transformer architecture, which is a type of neural network designed primarily for natural language processing tasks. My architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder, each composed of multiple identical layers.

Encoder:
Input Embedding: 512-dimensional embedding layer
Positional Encoding: added to the input embedding to preserve positional information
Transformer Layers: 12 identical layers, each consisting of:
Self-Attention Mechanism: computes attention weights for each token in the input sequence
Feed Forward Network: applies a linear transformation to the output of the self-attention mechanism
Layer Normalization: normalizes the output of the feed forward network
Dropout: applies dropout to the output of the layer normalization
Decoder:
Output Embedding: 512-dimensional embedding layer
Positional Encoding: added to the output embedding to preserve positional information
Transformer Layers: 12 identical layers, each consisting of:
Self-Attention Mechanism: computes attention weights for each token in the output sequence
Feed Forward Network: applies a linear transformation to the output of the self-attention mechanism
Layer Normalization: normalizes the output of the feed forward network
Dropout: applies dropout to the output of the layer normalization
